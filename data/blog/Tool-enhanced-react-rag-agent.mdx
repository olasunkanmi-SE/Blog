## Overview of Tool-enhanced Agents

Tool-enhanced agents are versatile problem solvers integrating multiple tools,
leveraging APIs, databases, and software to handle complex, multi-domain
workflows. They combine reasoning, retrieval, and execution for seamless operation.

### Key Features

1. **RAG Workflow Integration**
   - External knowledge through databases and APIs
   - LLM-enhanced context processing
   - Documentation integration

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - Real-time data integration
   - Domain-specific knowledge processing
   - Contextual understanding

3. **Advanced Reasoning**
   - ReAct-style reasoning patterns
   - Dynamic information retrieval
   - Task decomposition

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Low hallucination design
   - Correctness validation
   - Relevance optimization

## State Management Architecture

Now let's talk about how our agent keeps track of everything it needs to do. Think of it like a smart to-do list system with three main parts.

First, we need a way to track what the agent plans to do. We'll use a simple list of steps written as text strings. This is like having a checklist of tasks the agent needs to complete.

Second, we want to remember what the agent has already done and what happened with each task. For this, we'll use a list of pairs (or tuples in programming terms). Each pair contains both the action taken and what resulted from that action.

Lastly, we need to store two more important pieces of information: the original question that was asked (the input) and the final answer once the agent finishes its work (the response).

This setup gives our agent everything it needs to work effectively!

The plan method prompts the LLM to create the initial execution plan and updates the working memory with the user query and the generated plan.
