## Server Components Architecture

Server Components represent a fundamental shift in React application development, enabling server-side execution while reducing client-side JavaScript bundles.

### Understanding the Basics

Server Components run exclusively on the server and can:

- Access backend resources directly
- Keep sensitive data and logic on the server
- Reduce client-side JavaScript

### Client vs Server Components

Here's when to use each type:

#### Server Component Use Cases

- Data fetching
- Backend integration
- Database queries
- File system access

#### Client Component Use Cases

- Interactivity and event handling
- Browser APIs
- State management
- Client-side effects

## Advanced Routing Patterns

The App Router introduces a more intuitive way to handle routing in your applications.

### Layout System

Layouts in Next.js 13 provide:

- Persistent navigation
- Shared UI elements
- Nested layouts

### Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routing enables:

- Parameter-based pages
- Catch-all routes
- Optional catch-all segments

## Data Fetching Strategies

Next.js 13 introduces new patterns for data fetching that align better with React's paradigms.

### Server-Side Data Fetching

Implement efficient data fetching using:

```tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  return res.json()
}
```

### Static Data Generation

Optimize performance with static generation:

```tsx
export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
```

## Performance Optimization

Performance is crucial for modern web applications. Next.js 13 provides several tools to optimize your app.

### Image Optimization

The Image component provides:

- Automatic optimization
- Lazy loading
- Placeholder support

### Font Optimization

Implement efficient font loading:

```tsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google"

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] })
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 13 brings significant improvements to React development, making it easier to build fast, SEO-friendly, and developer-friendly web applications. By understanding and implementing these features correctly, you can create better web experiences for your users.
