üéæüõ†Ô∏è Software Engineer | Open Source Advocate | ML & AI Enthusiast

With over 6 years of professional software development experience, I am dedicated to contributing to the open-source community by developing software that resonates with a vast audience of fellow developers. I thrive on crafting robust and innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.

My passion for technology extends beyond my professional endeavors. I am actively exploring the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence, driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible.

In my leisure time, I enjoy the strategic and exhilarating nature of tennis, finding balance and rejuvenation through sport.
